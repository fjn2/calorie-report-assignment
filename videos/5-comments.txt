The previous video were missing some steps that are need only the first time that you start the server.
The full command list for the server are:
1:
docker-compose up
2:
In other terminal run: 
npx prisma deploy 
The above command is to apply migrations into the database, and create the schema.
3:
In the same terminal, run the e2e test to verify that everything is working fine and create the testing data.
npm test:e2e
Note: everyrtime that you run the e2e all the data in the DB is removed and re-created
